# Flow-Algorithm-Visualizer
> A Kotlin-based GUI application to visualize flow algorithm in real-time
- This project is a a **graph algorithm visualizer** built with Kotlin and Compose for Desktop. It aims to provide an interactive way to visualize and understand graph algorithm like Dijkstra, Kruskal and Prim. This project was created with the idea of providing students with a better and particularly visually prepared understanding in modules such as graph theory. The project is currently a **work in progress (WIP)** and feedback is welcome!
- It was developed as part of my current university module, Entscheidungsmodelle (Englisch: Decision-making models).
- All comments are written in English to ensure international readability and maintainability.

## Demo

## Features

- **Graph Representation:**
  - Nodes and edges can be added interactively.
  - Edge weights can be assigned and modified.
- **Algorithm Visualization:**
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path) ‚úÖ 
  - Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree) ‚Äì üöß
  - Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree) ‚Äì ‚è≥ 
- **Interactive UI:**
  - Drag-and-drop nodes.
  - Step-by-step visualization of algorithms.
